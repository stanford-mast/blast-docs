# Quickstart Guide

Get started with BLAST in minutes. This guide will walk you through installation, running the server, and making your first request.

## Installation

Install BLAST using pip:

```bash
pip install blastai
```

## Starting the Server

BLAST provides both a web UI and an OpenAI-compatible API server. Start both with a single command:

```bash
blastai serve
```

This will start:
- API server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- Web UI at `http://localhost:3000`

You can also run specific components:
- `blastai serve engine` - Run only the API server
- `blastai serve web` - Run only the web UI
- `blastai serve cli` - Run the CLI interface

## Using the API

BLAST provides an OpenAI-compatible API. Here's a simple example using the Python OpenAI client:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

# Initialize client pointing to local BLAST server
client = OpenAI(
    api_key="not-needed",  # BLAST doesn't require an API key
    base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8000"
)

# Create a streaming response
stream = client.responses.create(
    model="not-needed",  # Model name doesn't matter, BLAST uses its own engine
    input="Search for Python documentation and click on the first result",
    stream=True  # Enable streaming for real-time updates
)

# Process the stream
for event in stream:
    if event.type == "response.output_text.delta":
        # Print real-time thoughts/actions
        if ' ' in event.delta:  # Skip screenshots
            print(event.delta, end='', flush=True)
```

## Using the Web UI

Once you start the server with `blastai serve`, open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the web interface. The UI provides:

- Interactive chat interface
- Real-time streaming of responses
- Visual feedback for browser actions
- Task history and management
